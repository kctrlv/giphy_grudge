# README

This site was created to experiment with real-time updating in a chat room with action cable. It integrates with the Giphy API and allows users to chat with giphies, and play a round of competitive cards-against-humanity with typed Giphies. It is a work in progress, future commands may be integrated for additional functionality involving other APIs.
